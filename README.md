# Lost Seas

This is an old fashioned web based game. It is based upon Sid Meier's Pirates but with it's own ideas.
It is an adventure game with images, music and descriptive texts.

## Tech

The tech is too old to be proud of at this moment. I've begun to rebuild this project so many times.
Just now I realized that I need to do one thing at a time.

I would like to separate the backend logic from the frontend. The backend could still use CodeIgniter,
but be abstracted so that I could use NodeJS in the future. The frontend would be react with redux.

## Start this piraty shit up

1. Restore DB backup from ./backup
2. Make necessary changes to ./application/config/config.php, most likely base_url.
3. Make necessary changes to ./application/config/database.php
4. Try it out
